# SQL_Projects
I worked on many projects using SQL
The projects that i worked on are as follows:

->Data cleaning on restaurant databse
I worked on the restaurant database which i gathered from MAVEN ANALYTICS website.
I have dug into the customer data to see which items were doing well/not well and what are the items that are seemed to be liked by the top customers.
There are 3 main objectives that i worked on using the restaurant databse. They are
A)Exploring the menu_items table to get an idea of what's on the new menu,
B)Exploring the order_details table to get an overview on the data that is collected,
C)Using both the menu_items and order_details tables to understand the response of the customers to the new menu.

->Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on world_layoffs databse
I worked on the world_layoffs databse which i gathered it from kaggle
The objectives that i worked on using world_layoffs data are as follows,
A)Cleaning the data by removing null or duplicate values and then standardizing the data
B)I performed exploratory data analysis on the cleaned data to extract import and significant insights from the data.
