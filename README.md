I worked on the restaurant database which i gathered from MAVEN ANALYTICS website.
I have dug into the customer data to see which items were doing well/not well and what are the items that are seemed to be liked by the top customers.
There arre 3 main objectives that i worked on using the restaurant databse. They are
A)Exploring the menu_items table to get an idea of what's on the new menu,
B)Exploring the order_details table to get an overview on the data that is collected,
C)Using both the menu_items and order_details tables to understand the response of the customers to the new menu.
